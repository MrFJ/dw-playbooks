The Twisted Knight - A knight twisted by dark powers...

Intro:
"A symbol of hope, a champion of the innocents, praised by men and women alike, a true hero. In your previous life you were all of these things, but something changed you. You are a knight, but you are also something more... Will you cling to your past, or embrace your newfound unholy powers? Hide your true form, or release the darkness within!"

Credits: 
I have used a few moves and ideas from the Paladin class. I've also borrowed a move from Deios' Vampire Compendium Class, as well as some ideas from Peter Johansen's Vampire class.I also want to thank everyone here, on Discord, and on Google+ for the valuable feedback. If not for you, this class would probably have been a lot less interesting :)
